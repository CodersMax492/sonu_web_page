    <b><center>&#10084; A Beautiful Love Story: Shreyas and Sonu &#10084; </center></b><br>
    &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp In the vibrant campus of ATME College of Engineering, where dreams intertwine with reality, two hearts began their journey in the third semester of Electronics and Communication Engineering. Shreyas, a boy with a passion for technology and a warm smile, was known for his knack for solving complex problems. Sonu, on the other hand, was a bright spark, full of life and laughter, whose curiosity about the world was infectious.
<br>

<b> &#128516 The Beginning</b>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp  Their friendship blossomed during a group project. Late nights spent coding and brainstorming 
brought them closer, turning casual conversations into deep discussions about life, aspirations, and everything in between. Shreyas admired Sonu’s 
determination and her ability to find joy in the smallest things, while Sonu cherished Shreyas’s unwavering support and his clever insights. <br>
<br>
As they navigated through assignments and exams, their friendship flourished. They shared countless moments: studying together in the library, enjoying 
snacks at the canteen, and celebrating small victories. Every laugh and shared secret deepened their bond, creating a beautiful tapestry of memories. <br>

<b> &#128525 A Turning Point </b><br>
&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp  As the fourth semester approached, Shreyas began to notice a shift in his feelings. The way Sonu's eyes sparkled when she talked about her dreams, or how
 her laughter could light up the darkest days, made him realize that he felt something more than friendship. It was as if the universe conspired to make him see her in a different light.
<br>
One evening, while preparing for an upcoming project presentation, they found themselves alone on the college rooftop, the sunset painting the sky with hues 
of orange and pink. It was a magical moment. With the wind gently blowing, Shreyas felt an overwhelming urge to express his feelings. Heart racing, he turned
 to Sonu, but the words seemed to dance on the tip of his tongue.

<br> <b> &#129321 The Confession</b> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp  As the semester progressed, the tension grew. Shreyas confided in his friends, who encouraged him to take the leap of faith. One day, during a quiet stroll in
 the campus garden, he gathered all his courage. With butterflies in his stomach, he took a deep breath and finally said, “Sonu, you mean so much to me. I can’t 
 imagine my life without you. I think… I think I’ve fallen in love with you.”
<br>
Time seemed to stand still. Sonu looked at him, her eyes wide with surprise, then slowly softened into a warm smile. “I was hoping you’d say that,” she replied, 
her voice barely above a whisper. In that moment, both of them knew that they had crossed a beautiful threshold from friends to something more profound.

 memories. Each moment together felt like an adventure, filled with laughter and understanding.

They attended college events together, laughed with friends, and excelled in their studies, all while suppressing the love that once flourished.
<br>
Deep down, they knew they were making sacrifices for their families, but the ache of lost love was always present. They often reminisced about their journey together, cherishing the beautiful moments while mourning what could have been.

<br>
“Even if we can’t be together like we dreamt, I’ll always be your friend,” Shreyas vowed, his voice filled with determination. Sonu nodded, tears glistening in her eyes, understanding the weight of their promise.
<br>
